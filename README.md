# Flight-delay-prediction-using-Big-data
This project demonstrates practical applications of data science and machine learning in the aviation domain and serves as a foundation for further improvements such as real-time predictions or deployment as a web application.

✈️ Flight Delay Prediction System

This project focuses on predicting flight delays using historical aviation data and data analytics techniques. The goal is to analyze key factors influencing delays—such as departure time, airline, route, and operational conditions—and build a predictive model that can estimate whether a flight is likely to be delayed.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover patterns and trends in flight delays. Machine learning techniques are applied to train and evaluate predictive models, helping improve decision-making for airlines and passengers.

The implementation is primarily done using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization. The analysis and modeling workflow is documented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.
